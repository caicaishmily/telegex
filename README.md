# Telegex

This library is a client implementation of the official bot API, without any encapsulation. Original flavor!

## A little more cautious 😝

The models and APIs of this library are all constructed by DSL (well-designed macros) and contain complete typespecs.

It **fully supports** bot API version **5.2** and will continue to support the latest version.

However, there are still some methods that lack testing, so I must remind everyone to be careful. If you encounter a bug, please report it in time.

## Webhook support?

If you need webhook mode, please look forward to the 0.2.0 version.

## Examples & Help

There are some complete example projects in the [examples](https://github.com/Hentioe/telegex/tree/master/examples/) directory. Their code contains relatively complete comments to teach you how to get updates (receive messages) correctly and add related services to the supervision tree.

## Installation

Add Telegex to your `mix.exs` dependencies:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:telegex, "~> 0.1"}]
end
```

Run the `mix deps.get` command to install.

## Configuration

Add your bot token to `config/config.exs`, like this:

```elixir
config :telegex,
  token: "<BOT_TOKEN>",
  # This is the default and optional, will be passed as options to `HTTPoison.post/4`.
  timeout: 1000 * 15,
  # This is the default and optional, will be passed as options to `HTTPoison.post/4`.
  recv_timeout: 1000 * 10
```

## Usage

Here are some examples of common API calls.
